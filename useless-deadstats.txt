HELP FILE FOR THE USELESS DEADSTATS SERVER
---- ---- --- --- ------- --------- ------

Send mail to "stats@gdead.berkeley.edu" or "deadstats@gdead.berkeley.edu"
        (they are equivalent).

To use the Useless DeadStats Server, you have four options.  Each
        option is accessed by putting it's keyword in the "Subject:"
        line (case doesn't count and you can put the keyword anywhere
        in the Subject: line).  The four options are:

1. help - receive this file.

2. comment - send a comment along to the Useless DeadStats Server Manager.

3. setlists - Obtain setlists.  The body of your message should contain
        the list of dates to include.  See below for the dates syntax.
4. stats - Obtain Useless DeadStats.  The body of your message should contain
        the list of dates to include.  See below for the dates syntax.


SYNTAX OF DATES:

        Dates should be listed:
                - one per line
                - left justified
                - in MMDDYY format
                - in any order
                - to do a list of non-consecutive dates, just list them
                        one per line
                - to do a whole year, use YY0000 (i.e. 910000 will
                        include all shows in 1991)
                - to do a range of years, use YY9999 followed by YY0000
                        (see example below)
                - to do a range of dates, put a 999999 between the first
                        and last date
                        (see example below)
                - you can combine these features (see below)

RANGE OF DATES:
----- -- -----

        -----------
        *IMPORTANT*: My database file only has 1974 -> present date.
        -----------  You cannot request dates before 1974.  This may change
                     in the future.
                     The database is updated daily.
                     Please *do not request more than 500 shows* at a time.
